We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, addiction, and on and on.

This list represents evidence-based and powerful voices on the other side -- a collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.

It is *not* a comprehensive list. It is *not* meant to be a full literature review. It is *not* authoritative. It does *not* claim to be unbiased.

But, this list *is* a collection of sound research that shows **games do good**. That said **please note** that research is ever changing. If something here has been discredited, disproven, or shown to be problematic, please open a pull request.

We all knew it.

## Peer Reviewed Research
Game Studies is still a young field, and there aren't nearly as many well-founded studies as we need (working on it!), but there has been a lot of good research on the *positive* aspects of gaming.
These are peer-reviewed, methodologically sound studies from a variety of disciplines.

Mumford, Enrique Solis, Lisa Flook, Elena G. Patsenko, Craig G. Anderson, Constance Steinkuehler, and Richard J. Davidson. Npj Science of Learning 3, no. 1 (August 7, 2018): 13.
    - The researchers created an engaging videogame in which middle school students played as an alien who had to master "building emotional rapport" through facial expressions. 
    The research found that participants showed stronger connectivity in the brain networks that are related to empathy and taking perspective. 
    Some showed stronger neural networks that are linked to emotion regulation.

These results indicate that children who frequently play video games may be socially cohesive with peers and integrated into the school community.  We caution against over interpretation, however, as setting limits on screen usage remains and important component of parental responsibility as an overall strategy for student success"
