# Contribution Guidelines
Suggestions, edits, and other contributions are **welcome**.
This is a project aimed at amassing **evidence based** and/or **professional quality** reports and studies that show the positive effects games can have.
This is not limited to videogames, thought (for the moment) most of the entries sway that way.
If you would like to add or edit an entry, please follow the guide below. You will be credited for any substantial changes.
Thanks!
