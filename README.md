We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, and on and on.

These are the evidence-based and powerful voices on the other side.
This list is a clearly one-sided collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.

It is *not* a comprehensive list. It is *not* meant to be a full literature review. It is *not* authoritative. It does *not* claim to be unbiased.

But, this list *is* a collection of sound research that shows **games do good**, too.

We all knew it.

## Peer Reviewed Research
Game Studies is still a young field, and there aren't nearly as many well-founded studies as we need (working on it!), but there has been a lot of good research on the *positive* aspects of gaming.
These are peer-reviewed, methodologically sound studies from a variety of disciplines.

    - The researchers created an engaging videogame in which middle school students played as an alien who had to master "building emotional rapport" through facial expressions. 
    The research found that participants showed stronger connectivity in the brain networks that are related to empathy and taking perspective. 
    Some showed stronger neural networks that are linked to emotion regulation.
    - See [A video game can change the brain, may improve empathy in middle schoolers]() for an official introduction and news write-up of the game and research.

## News Articles and Corroborated Stories
Games are powerful. This is a collection of news articles and personal stories about the power of games to do *good*.

## Non Academic
As a researcher I value evidence-based, peer-reviewed studies.
But, there is enormous value in anecdotal pieces, reviews, and more introductory articles and videos.
These may not be peer-reviewed, but they are all of high quality, produced or written by experts, professionals, and enthusiasts of the highest caliber.

- [Hatred - Crossing the Line from Violence to Sadism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6xQlnzffRg)
    - This video's primary focus is a critique of a game that crosses the line from violence to sadism. 
    But, in the first half and the last bit, it details (beautifully) the cathartic power of games and a well-crafted game's ability to help us process and manage our emotions.

## Putting the "Games are Bad" Myth to Rest
Unfortunately, we often hear of the tragic effects videogames have on people, especially children.
This is a short list of quality, evidence based pieces that disagree.
