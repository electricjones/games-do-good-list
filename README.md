# Games Do Good
We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, and on and on.

These are the evidence-based and powerful voices on the other side.
This list is a clearly one-sided collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.

It is *not* a comprehensive list. It is *not* meant to be a full literature review. And it is *not* authoritative.

But, this list *is* a collection of sound research that shows **games do good**, too.

We all knew it.

## Peer Reviewed Research
Game Studies is still a young field, and there aren't nearly as many well-founded studies as we need (working on it!), but there has been a lot of good research on the *positive* aspects of gaming.
These are peer-reviewed, methodologically sound studies from a variety of disciplines.

## News Articles and Corroborated Stories
Games are powerful. This is a collection of news articles and personal stories about the power of games to do *good*.

## Non Academic
As a researcher I value evidence-based, peer-reviewed studies.
But, there is enormous value in anecdotal pieces, reviews, and more introductory articles and videos.
These may not be peer-reviewed, but they are all of high quality, produced or written by experts, professionals, and enthusiasts of the highest calibre.

- [Hatred - Crossing the Line from Violence to Sadism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6xQlnzffRg)
    - This video's primary focus is a critique of a game that crosses the line from violence to sadism. 
    But, in the first half and the last bit, it details (beautifully) the cathartic power of games and a well-crafted game's ability to help us process and manage our emotions.
